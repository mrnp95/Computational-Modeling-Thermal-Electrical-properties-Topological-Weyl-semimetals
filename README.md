# Computational-study-Thermal-Electrical-properties-Topological-Weyl-semimetals
This repo contains code for developing a computational model of topological Weyl semimetals (WSM) and studying thermal ans electrical properties of the system. The results obtained from this simulation has been published in [Europian Journal of Physics B, in 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2017-80437-4). The brief explanation of physics, details of the thermal and electrical properties formulations, and the conclusions obtained from the simulation are also presented in the paper.  

## Abstract
Topological Weyl semimetals (WSM), a new state of quantum matter with gapless nodal bulk spectrum and open Fermi arc surface states, have recently sparked enormous interest in condensed matter physics. The tilted conical spectrum and finite DOS at Fermi level have recently been shown to produce interesting effects such as a chiral anomaly induced longitudinal magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic in direction and a novel anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we consider the anomalous Nernst effect in type-II WSMs in the absence of an external magnetic field using the framework of semi-classical Boltzmann theory. We show that the anomalous Nernst response in these systems is strongly anisotropic in space, and can serve as a reliable signature of type-II Weyl semimetals in a host of magnetic systems with spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry.

## Brief description of the computational model
The computational model has been implemented through several steps and the following properties have been calculated thereafter. 

* 1: Defining Hamiltonian of the system. (eq 1)
* 2: Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the hamiltonian. (fig 1, fig 2)
* 3: Calculation of Berry curvature. (eq 31)
* 4: Longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity. (eq 21, 22)
* 5: Longitudinal and transverse electical conductivity. (eq 23, eq 24)
* 6: Estimation of coefficient of anisotropy. (eq 35, eq 36)
